KeeperScore™ – AI-Powered Goalkeeper Valuation & Performance Intelligence Platform

KeeperScore™ is a goalkeeper-first AI and Machine Learning software system designed to redefine how goalkeeping performance is measured, interpreted, and valued.

The platform addresses a major structural gap in football analytics: the absence of a unified, objective system that translates goalkeeper performance into intrinsic and financial value.

Core Objectives

Establish a transparent, data-driven Golden Glove selection system

Quantify intrinsic goalkeeper value beyond clean sheets

Bridge performance analytics with financial ROI

Improve goalkeeper development through AI-driven insights

Platform Architecture
1️⃣ Match Mode AI Tracker

A real-time performance scoring engine that evaluates goalkeepers per match using a structured 3–6–9 points system across six core categories:
